= Message issues

All warnings produced by the filters have carefully been
traced to their sources and found harmless.

Some errors occurred both during data extraction from the
UN/ECE sources and during diagram tests. The affected
sources and/or the resulting csv files have been patched,
and the issues reported to UN/ECE.

Depending upon verification by the directory maintainers,
these patches will remain in place or be undone.

I'd say that all *known* issues have been properly accounted for.

== Recommendations

* When in doubt, double-check the supplied message structures
  with the UN sources if you happen to need one of the
  patched messages.
* Patch the *.csv files if you really want to revert to the
  original values.
* Let me know if you find other issues!
