= "NORM DATABASE" ADD-ON for the EDI TOOLKIT for RUBY (edi4r)

This is Ruby gem <b>edi4r-tdid</b> version 
:include:VERSION

It provides the full range of UN/EDIFACT Trade Data Interchance
Directories (TDIDs) to the <b>edi4r</b> gem.
 
== Installation

Install it as any other Ruby gem, e.g.:

  sudo gem install edi4r-tdid-<version>.gem

It supplements the core <b>edi4r</b> gem. While not strictly required,
I recommend to install <b>edi4r</b>, as there are only few people who
would use this add-on without it.

== Usage

  require_gem 'edi4r-tdid'
