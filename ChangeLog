== 0.6.3.1
Bug fix for Windows implementation of class "Pathname".

== 0.6.3
New test (test_segments.rb) which actually loads all segments of
all message types, thus applying more tests to the CSV files.

This test discovered a new bug. This was fixed in CDE_filter.rb and
seg_filter.rb. Now some previously missing segments and CDEs at the beginning
of files ED[CS]D.*.csv are included.

The new test also searches for "distant duplicates", i.e. (C)DE of the
same name in a single segment, but with some other entity in between.
Many such occurrences are found in some early release - please ignore.

Note that the search for distant DE duplicates within CDEs is 
commented out: There are many such cases, it appears to be a
frequent feature of UN/EDIFACT CDEs. Ex.: 3055, 1131 in C088, C243;
5275 in C203; 7064, 7143 in C402.
Keep the existance of such distant duplicates in mind when accessing
them through method a3055 and such: Though you get all occurrences back
as an array, remember that they are not adjacent.
