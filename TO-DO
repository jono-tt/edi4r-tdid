= To do

[Code lists]
  Currently, the code list directories are not made available

[Syntax Version 4]
  UN/EDIFACT syntax version 4 might have implications also on this 
  package. Tests with SV4 will become available with general SV4
  support in the basic edi4r gem.

[More tests]
  :-)

[Adding the development environment]
  All *.csv files in the "untdid" folder are generated from
  the original ZIP files as distributed by UNECE (CEFACT).

  Unfortunately, these ZIP files contain basically plain ASCII
  text files intended for human use, not for machine use.
  They come with many exceptions, idiosyncracies, and 
  plain bugs, which considerably hamper any automatic attempt
  to derive a structured normdata base.

  A combination of filter scripts, a Makefile, and automated patches
  was employed to get this job done. It is currently too brittle
  for regular distribution. Let me know if you are interested
  and/or want to contribute here.

[Auto-detection of Ruby 1.9]
  Ruby 1.9 must be run with option -E ISO-8859-1, while Ruby 1.8
  must NOT receive this option. Makefiles should detect the installed
  version of Ruby and adjust calls automatically, while today they
  need to be patched manually.

[Rakefile]
  Abandon make, use rake instead
